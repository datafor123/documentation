# **{{ userConfig.siteConfig.name }} API Overview**

Optimibi provides a robust set of APIs that enable seamless interaction with its platform, allowing users to programmatically manage and automate various functionalities. These APIs cover a wide range of features, including **user and role management**, **access control**, **file and folder operations**, **data modeling**, **system configuration**, **user personalization**, and **parameter management**.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and integrating Optimibi’s API into your workflow.


## **1. API Functional Categories**

### **Files & Folders**

- Manage file and folder operations, including **uploading, downloading, renaming, and deletion**.
- Organize and structure content storage efficiently.

### **Reports & Models**

- Handle report execution, querying, and exporting analytical results.
- Interact with data models to optimize reporting capabilities.

### **Users & Permissions**

- Manage **user authentication**, **role-based access control (RBAC)**, and **permissions** to ensure secure data access.
- Grant or restrict access to specific resources within the platform.

### **Data Sources & Metadata**

- Connect to external databases and retrieve metadata for seamless integration.
- Manage **data assets** and ensure consistency across different environments.

### **Scheduling & Alerts**

- Automate business intelligence (BI) operations by creating **scheduled tasks**.
- Configure **notifications and alerts** for timely data updates and system monitoring.


## **2. API Request Format**

Optimibi APIs adhere to **RESTful principles**, utilizing standard HTTP methods for communication:

- **GET** – Retrieve data
- **POST** – Create resources or execute actions
- **PUT** – Update existing resources
- **DELETE** – Remove resources

### **Data Format**

- Both request and response bodies primarily use **JSON**.
- Refer to individual endpoint documentation for **specific parameters, payload structures, and sample requests**.


## **3. API Response Handling**

All API responses adhere to standard **HTTP status codes** to indicate the outcome of requests:

| HTTP Status Code              | Meaning                | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **200 OK**                    | Success                | The request was successfully processed.                      |
| **400 Bad Request**           | Invalid Request        | The request contained incorrect or missing parameters.       |
| **401 Unauthorized**          | Authentication Failure | The request lacks valid authentication credentials.          |
| **403 Forbidden**             | Access Denied          | The authenticated user does not have permission to perform this action. |
| **404 Not Found**             | Resource Not Found     | The requested resource could not be located.                 |
| **500 Internal Server Error** | Server Error           | An error occurred on the server side.                        |

Proper error handling is recommended to ensure smooth API integration.


## **4. API Usage & Integration**

### **1. Browser-Based Access**

- Some **GET** endpoints can be accessed directly via a web browser for quick retrieval of data.

### **2. Debugging & Testing Tools**

- Utilize tools like **Postman, cURL, or API testing frameworks** to send requests and debug API responses.

### **3. Programmatic Integration**

- Optimibi APIs can be integrated into applications via scripting languages such as **Python, Java, JavaScript, or any HTTP client**.
- API access can be embedded into workflows for automated **data processing, reporting, and system configuration**.


## **5. Authentication & Security**

Optimibi supports multiple authentication mechanisms to ensure **secure and controlled API access**.

### **1. Session-Based Authentication (Cookie)**

- When authenticated via the **Optimibi web interface**, the session cookie can be used for subsequent API requests.
- Requests should include the session cookie in the **HTTP headers**.

**Example (Request Headers):**

```http
Cookie: session-flushed=true;
        JSESSIONID=72B613231EB93BA9EB9DF9417E1B0F67;
        session-expiry=1741238288603;
        server-time=1741231088603
```

Supported login mechanisms include:

- **Username/Password**
- **OAuth2**
- **LDAP**
- **SAML**
- **CAS (Central Authentication Service)**

### **2. Basic Authentication**

- Uses **Base64-encoded credentials** for authentication.
- Ensure that sensitive credentials are transmitted securely over **HTTPS**.

**Example (Request Headers):**

```http
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

(The encoded value represents `admin:password`—replace with actual credentials.)

### **3. JWT Token Authentication**

- Optimibi can be configured to support **JWT authentication**.
- The token should be included in the request, either in the URL or header.

**Example Usage:**

```http
https://your-optimibi-url/api/endpoint?token=<YOUR_VALID_JWT_TOKEN>
```


## **6. Best Practices for API Security**

- Always **use HTTPS** to prevent unauthorized data interception.
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to restrict sensitive actions.
- Regularly **rotate authentication credentials** to enhance security.
- Monitor API usage logs for **unusual access patterns**.


## **7. Getting Started**

To quickly start using Optimibi APIs:

1. **Log in** to Optimibi and obtain the necessary authentication credentials.
2. **Explore available API endpoints** in the documentation.
3. **Use an API client** (such as Postman or cURL) to test API requests.
4. **Integrate API calls** into your application workflow.
5. **Ensure proper error handling** and security measures during implementation.

For additional details, refer to the **specific API endpoint documentation**.


## **Conclusion**

Optimibi APIs empower users to efficiently interact with the platform, enabling automation, integration, and advanced data operations. By following best practices and leveraging the provided authentication methods, users can build **secure and scalable** solutions tailored to their needs.
