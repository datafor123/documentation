**Effective Date:** **May 5, 2024**

We value your privacy and understand your concerns about how your personal information is used and shared. By using or accessing Optimibi’s services, you agree to the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your information as described below.

#### 1. Scope of This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy covers how we handle personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) collected when you visit or use Optimibi’s services. However, it does not apply to companies we do not own or control, or to individuals we do not manage. We collect various types of Personal Information as outlined below and use this information for internal operations related to our services, including personalization, service improvement, user account creation and management, communication, and analyzing service usage. In certain cases, we may share some Personal Information with third parties, but only under the conditions described in this policy.

#### 2. Will This Privacy Policy Change?

As we continuously strive to improve our services, we may need to update this Privacy Policy periodically. If changes occur, we will notify you via announcements on the Optimibi website, email notifications, or other means. Please note that even if you choose not to receive legal notices (or have not provided an email address), these notices will still govern your use of our services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding them. If you continue using our services after changes to this Privacy Policy, it means you accept those changes. Information collected will be used in accordance with the updated policy.

#### 3. What Information Does Optimibi Collect?

##### Information You Provide:

We collect information you voluntarily provide, such as your name, email address, and phone number, through registration processes or account settings. You can view, update, and correct this information through the service's features. If you wish to access all Personal Information we hold about you or request its deletion, please email us at **info@Optimibi.com**.

We may contact you if you have provided contact details. For example, if you provide an email address, we may send you product announcements, security alerts, updates about new Optimibi versions, or information about your service usage. If you do not wish to receive such communications, you can opt out using the unsubscribe link in the emails.

##### Information Collected Automatically:

Whenever you interact with our services, we automatically receive and record information from your browser or device, such as your IP address, device ID, cookie data, browser type, and requested pages or features. We may use this data to personalize content, improve our services, and enhance your user experience.

#### 4. Will Personal Information Be Shared with Third Parties?

We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in an identifiable form to third parties. However, we may share your Personal Information under the following circumstances:

- **Anonymized Information:** We may anonymize your Personal Information and share it with our partners. Additionally, we may provide aggregate usage data to partners to help them understand how users interact with our services.
- **Agents and Service Providers:** We collaborate with third-party companies to provide related products or services. We share Personal Information only to the extent necessary to deliver these services. We take measures to ensure these partners adhere to appropriate privacy protection standards when handling your data.
- **Legal Compliance:** If we believe it is necessary to comply with legal processes, court orders, enforce our Terms of Use, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Optimibi, our employees, users, or others, we may access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as required.

#### 5. How Can I Protect My Personal Information?

Your account is protected by a password to ensure your privacy and security. If you access your account through a third-party site or service, you may have additional or different login protections provided by that third party. You must prevent unauthorized access by safeguarding your password and login information and logging out after using your account.

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your Personal Information, but we cannot guarantee absolute security. Unauthorized access, hardware or software failures, and other factors may affect the security of user information.

#### 6. What Personal Information Can I Access?

Through your account settings, you can access and update the Personal Information you have provided. If you have any questions about accessing or updating your Personal Information, please contact us.

#### 7. What Are My Choices?

You can choose not to provide certain information, but some data may be required to register or use specific features.

If you wish to delete your account or stop receiving our communications, you can contact us via email. Some information may still be retained in our records after account deletion, but we will ensure it is no longer used to identify you.
