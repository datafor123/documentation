# üîó Lineage Analysis

**Lineage Analysis** is a powerful feature provided by Datafor BI that helps users trace the dependencies between reports, analytical models, and data sources. It offers a clear end-to-end view from the data source to the final report, supporting data governance, impact analysis, and troubleshooting.

With the lineage graph, you can easily understand:

- Which models and data sources a report depends on  
- Which reports use a given analytical model, and what data sources it relies on  
- Whether a data source affects multiple models and reports
