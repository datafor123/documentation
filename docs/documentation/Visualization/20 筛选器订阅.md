# Data Filtering in Chart Components via Filter Subscriptions

A subscription mechanism is used to link filter components with chart components. The value set in a filter dynamically filters the data displayed in the chart components that subscribe to it.

## Rationale Behind Using Subscriptions

The subscription mechanism provides enhanced flexibility in controlling which chart components are affected by the filter. In some scenarios, certain chart components on a report page may need to display data independently of the filter settings. For example, a “summary” component might always need to show a constant value regardless of the filter criteria. In such cases, this component should not subscribe to the filter.

## Establishing a Subscription

1. **Activate the Action Panel:**
   Select the filter, then switch to the “Action” tab in the right-hand panel.

2. **Configure the Subscriber:**
   In the “Subscriber” dropdown, choose the chart component that you wish to subscribe to the filter.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Can a filter subscribe to chart components that use a different analytical model?**
   Yes, subscription is possible even if the filter and the chart components are based on different analytical models.

2. **How are the model fields of the filter and the chart components matched?**

   - The matching is based on the field captions: as long as the caption of the filter field is the same as that of the field used in the chart component’s model, the filter value will apply to the chart.
   - The system prioritizes matching based on the Unique Name. If there are two fields with the same caption (e.g., “Product”) in different dimensions, the field with a matching Unique Name will be filtered.

   **Example:**

   - **Filter:** Uses a field with the caption “Product” and Unique Name `[Product].[Product Name]`.
   - **Chart Component:** Contains two fields with the caption “Product,” having Unique Names `[Product].[Product Name]` and `[Sales order].[Product Name]` respectively.
     In this case, the filter value will only affect the field with the Unique Name `[Product].[Product Name]`.
