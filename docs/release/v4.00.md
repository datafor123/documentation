11. Fixed an issue where table and field names starting with a number caused an error when selecting a table in modeling without choosing a data connection.  
12. Addressed an issue where copying a metric card resulted in a loss of data formatting.  
13. Fixed an issue where adjusting metric positions in bar and line charts had no effect.  
14. Resolved an issue where drop-down components bound to parameters required a page refresh to update subscribed components.  
15. Corrected the **Rank** functionâ€™s sorting behavior to ensure proper ranking order.
