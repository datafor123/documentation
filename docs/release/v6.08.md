2. **Enhanced Value-Axis Range Algorithm**: Improved range calculation for coordinate-based charts, offering more precise control over chart axes.
3. **Configurable Axis Limits**: Users can now set custom minimum and maximum values for both the Y and X axes, providing more flexibility in data visualization.
4. **Straight-Line Analysis for Scatter Plots**: A new feature enabling straight-line trend analysis in scatter plots, improving trend recognition.
5. **Optimized Query Logic for Grouped Pie Charts**: Enhanced efficiency in processing grouped pie chart queries for faster rendering.
6. **Column Locking in Tables**: Added support for locking columns within table components to improve usability and maintain layout consistency.
7. **Performance Optimization in Data Panel**: Improved rendering efficiency when selecting multiple fields, reducing lag and enhancing user experience.
8. **Fixed Layer-Switching Issues**: Resolved issues related to switching layers within tab pages, ensuring smoother navigation.
9. **Expanded Data Security**: Report parameters, global parameters, and system parameters are now supported for enhanced data security, ensuring more control over data access.
10. **MDX Function Performance Enhancements**: Optimized execution of MDX functions, including `Level.Members`, `Except`, `Generate`, and `CrossJoin`, improving query performance.
11. **Improved Performance for Large Data Columns with Filters**: Enhanced processing efficiency when applying filters to large datasets, improving overall performance.
12. **Measure Support for Properties**: Now supports properties within measures, including MDX expressions, enabling more complex calculations.
13. **Automatic Dimension Exclusion**: Unrelated dimensions across multiple fact tables are now automatically excluded from analysis, improving accuracy and reducing complexity.
14. **Enhanced License Verification**: Role validation is now integrated into the license verification process, ensuring more accurate and secure license management.
