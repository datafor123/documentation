# **v8.00 Release Notes**

## 1) New: Multi-tenancy

A centralized tenant management console for **Super Admins**, designed to create and manage multiple tenants in a unified way.

**Key capabilities**

- **Full tenant lifecycle management**: Create tenants, assign subscription plans, configure seats (Creator / Reader Seats), set trial end dates (Trial End Date / Expiration Date), manage tenant administrators, enable/disable tenants, view audit logs, and delete tenants (irreversible).
- **Tenant template `template0`**: New tenants are created by cloning the default template `template0`, which typically includes (but is not limited to) white-label settings, data sources, analytic models, and sample pages/content.

**Upgrade & operations notes**

- If you upgrade the system using an **upgrade package**, you must **manually create the `superAdmin` account**—it is not created automatically during the upgrade.
- If you upgrade the system using an **upgrade package**, `template0` is **not created automatically**. You must **manually create the tenant template** before creating new tenants.

## 2) New: AI Chat (Preview)

A conversational analytics assistant built into the **dashboard/page editor**. Ask questions in natural language and it will generate executable query results and chart previews based on the selected **Analysis Model**, with one-click insertion into the page.
