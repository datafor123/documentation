Heap space is allocated when a process starts. Although JVM is good at dynamic memory management, using too much memory may cause JVM to perform poorly or even crash. On Datafor Server, using too little memory may result in performance degradation. If you use Datafor Server to process large datasets or high concurrency, you can improve its performance by setting the maximum memory usage of JVM.</p><p>This article explains how to increase the memory limit of JVM by editing the startup script file of Datafor Server. Following the steps in this article, you can change the memory settings of Datafor Server to meet your specific needs.</p><p>Important Note: Changing the memory usage of JVM may affect the stability of Datafor Server.
