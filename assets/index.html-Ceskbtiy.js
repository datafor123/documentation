For example, once May 1998 is selected, the line chart will only show data for May 1998. This is the default behavior: the time filter directly affects the subscribed charts.</p><p>However, when analyzing trends, it is often more useful to display a broader time range leading up to the selected date. For example, if May 1998 is selected, you may want the line chart to show data for the previous 12 months (from June 1997 to May 1998). Similarly, if the time filter is set to March 1998, the line chart should display data from April 1997 to March 1998.</p><p>To achieve this, you can enable <strong>Relative Date Filtering</strong>, which calculates a relative time range based on a specified <strong>Reference Time</strong>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong>: By default, the time filter affects the line chart as shown below, limiting it to the selected month, which is not suitable for trend analysis.</p></blockquote><div align="left"><img src="'+s+'"></div><h2 id="configuration-steps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#configuration-steps"><span>Configuration Steps</span></a></h2><p>Relative date filtering involves two main settings: defining the <strong>Reference Time</strong> and configuring the <strong>Relative Time Condition</strong>.</p><h3 id="_1-configure-a-time-filter-in-the-chart-s-filters-area" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-configure-a-time-filter-in-the-chart-s-filters-area"><span>1.

Set the Filter Type to “Relative”</span></a></h3><p>In the filter component’s settings panel, set the <strong>Filter type</strong> to <strong>Relative</strong>. This enables the use of a Reference Time and a Relative Time Condition to dynamically calculate a date range.</p><div align="left"><img src="'+o+'"></div><h3 id="_3-choose-a-reference-time" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-choose-a-reference-time"><span>3. Choose a Reference Time</span></a></h3><p>Relative date filtering requires a base point, known as the <strong>Reference Time</strong>. By default, this is set to <strong>Current time</strong>, meaning the relative range is calculated based on the current system time.</p><p>To base the relative range on the user&#39;s selection in the dashboard’s time filter (or time axis component), set the <strong>Reference Time</strong> to that filter component. This ensures the chart will use the selected time as the base for calculating the relative time range.</p><div align="left"><img src="'+l+'"></div><h3 id="_4-set-the-relative-time-condition" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-set-the-relative-time-condition"><span>4. Set the Relative Time Condition</span></a></h3><p>Finally, configure the <strong>Relative Time Condition</strong> to define the desired range. For instance, to show a 12-month trend ending with the selected month, set the start offset to <strong>-11</strong> (including the current month) and set the duration to 12 months.</p><p>Once configured, selecting May 1998 in the time filter will make the line chart show data from June 1997 to May 1998. Selecting March 1998 will show data from April 1997 to March 1998.</p><div align="left"><img src="'+h+'"></div><h2 id="summary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary"><span>Summary</span></a></h2><p>Relative Date Filtering allows dashboards to flexibly define dynamic time windows, enabling trend and cumulative analyses. When your business scenario requires showing a rolling time window (e.g., the past 12 months) based on the user’s selection, configure the reference time and relative time condition accordingly. This way, selecting a specific month while viewing data for several months leading up to it becomes possible, enhancing the dashboard’s interactivity and analytical power.</p>',24)])])}const f=t(c,[["render",d]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/documentation/Analysis/Relative-Date-Filtering/","title":"Relative Date Filtering","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Relative Date Filtering","permalink":"/documentation/Analysis/Relative-Date-Filtering/","createTime":"2026/02/13 07:03:16"},"headers":[],"readingTime":{"minutes":1.91,"words":574},"git":{},"filePathRelative":"documentation/Analysis/200 Relative Date Filtering.md"}');export{f as comp,p as data};
